# Change Log

## unreleased

### Changes
- Stop tagging events with "archived" and "escalated", and only use
  "evebox.archived" and "evebox.escalated". This should not be noticed
  as EveBox has been using both tags for a very long.

### Fixes
- Fix the index_pattern when adding a template to Elasticsearch with a
  non logstash index.

### Breaking Changes
- Remove adding of Suricata rules to events on import. Suricata can
  now be configured to include the rule in an alert.

## 0.11.0 - 2020-03-26

### Enhancements
- Handle Filebeat overriding the "host" field with its own object by
  normalizing the sensor name before rendering. If Filebeat is used,
  the Suricata provided sensor name is lost, so use the Filebeat
  provided host.name
  instead. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/100
- Allow `esimport` to read from multiple eve files. If bookmarking is
  used, `--bookmark-dir` must be used instead of
  `--bookmark-filename`. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/98
- Support Elastic
  Search 7. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/112
- Reduce the amount of per minute logs by moving some message to debug
  (verbose) mode. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/116

### Fixes
- Show event services on first click through to event, rather than having
  to refresh to see them.
  Issue: https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/109
- Fix sensor name display when event is clicked on in inbox or alert
  view. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/104

### Breaking Changes
- `esimport` now uses a default index of `logstash` instead of
  `evebox` to match common usage.
- The `evebox` application now requires a command name. It will not
  fallback to the server command anymore.
- The EveBox server will now bind to localhost by default instead of
  being open. Use the `--host` command line option to accept connections
  more openly. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/110
- GitHub authentication has been removed. Looks like its been broken for
  a little while now.

### Known Issues
- Filebeat: The basic views work with Filebeat indices but searching
  does not. This is due to Filebeat indexing fields as keywords which
  complicates "free text" searching. This will probably not be fixed,
  but instead focus will be on supporting Elastic Search ECS (or more
  simply the Suricata plugin for filebeat) -
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/97

### Deprecations
- LetsEncrypt support: This is better done by a reverse proxy where
  LetsEncrypt support is more of a design goal.
- Plain Filebeat indices will likely be deprecated due to issues with
  searching.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.10.2..0.11.0)

## 0.10.2 - 2019-01-30

### Fixed
- If EveBox is installing the Elastic Search template, re-configure
  after installation to figure out the keyword suffix instead of
  requiring EveBox to be
  restarted. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/85
- Update the Brace Javascript dependency. Fixes issue loading event
  view. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/91
- In agg reports use default min_doc_count of 1 instead of 0. Prevents
  values from showing in the report that have 0 hits, when the number
  of results in less than the number of results requested. Affects:
  Elastic Search. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/99
- Remove top rrdata from DNS report as its not really valid with DNS
  v2 alerts. Best to remove it until an alternate metric can be used
  to report on DNS responses. Closes
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/72.
- Fixed pager button on "Events"
  view. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/92
- Fix issue with drop down event type selector on events view page
  where choosing an event type was taking users back to the index.
- Fix pcap downloads when authentication is on. This requires setting
  a cookie as this isn't an XHR/REST style request.
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/90
- Fix doc on adding a
  user. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/89

  Search 2 templates out there.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.9.0...0.9.1)

## 0.9.0 - 2018-02-07

**Fixed**

  reload. https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/61
- [Elastic Search] Per IP report when the src_ip and dest_ip fields
  have been mapped to the IP datatype
  (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/56)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.8.1...0.9.0)

## 0.8.1 - 2017-12-10

**Added**
- Commenting support for PostgreSQL.
  - With "has:comment" query string support.
  - And "comment:SOME_STRING" for search comments.

  (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/54).
- Add "Newer" and "Oldest" buttons to the "Events" view.

**Fixed**
- Fix an issue with updating the "active" row after archiving events.
- Strip trailing slashes in the Elastic Search URL
  (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/55).

**Changes**
- In requests to the backend, rename maxTs, minTs, eventType to
  max_ts, min_ts and event_type.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.8.0...0.8.1)

## 0.8.0 - 2017-06-30

**Added**
- The agent, and the server when reading logs can now add the rule to
  the event by providing the location of the rule files in the
  configuration.
- Add option to esimport to add rule to event.
- If an event has a "rule" object it will now be displayed in the
  event details.
- Initial support for PostgreSQL. Like SQLite this does not yet
  support reporting.
- Event history recording. A timestamp and username will be recorded
  when an alert is archived, escalated or de-escalated.
- Support for commenting on events (Elastic Search only)
  (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/36).
- Specific support for displaying the HTTP response body if available
  in Eve entries. Requires Suricata 4.0.0-rc1 or newer
  (https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/40)
  
**Fixed**
- Fix an issue where alerts may not be archived if their @timestamp
  and timestamp fields were out of sync -
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/48.
- A usability issue where the alert view would be reset to 100 items
  after arching event, if previously set to "all" -
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/49.
- Elastic Search mapping errors on flow and netflow reports -
  https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/issues/39

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.7.0...0.8.0)

## 0.7.0 - 2017-04-22

**Added**
- Optional authentication. Authentication can now be enabled with
  simple usernames and passwords. GitHub can also be used for
  authentication using Oauth2, however, the user must first be created
  in EveBox.
- New command, _evebox config users_, to create users.
- Create and use a "configdb". This is a database separate from event
  databases for storing data such as users. Will contain more
  configuration data in the future.
- TLS support. The server can be provided with a certificate and key
  to enable TLS. The "gencert" subcommand has been added to help
  generate self signed certificates. Or, if the server is publically
  accessible, Letsencrypt can be used.

**Breaking Changes**
- RPM and Debian package installs started with systemd now run as the
  user _evebox_. This really only matters if using an SQLite database,
  and the database file will need to have its permissions updated so
  the _evebox_ user will have read and write access to it.
- All binary builds are now linked with SQLite as SQLite is used for
  the configuration database. This really only matters when trying to
  cross compile EveBox, which may or may not work going forward.

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.6.1...0.7.0)

## 0.6.1 - 2017-04-02
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.5.0...0.6.1)
- Upgrade to Angular 4 and Angular CLI 1.0 and use its AOT compilation
  feature reducing the Javascript size even further. Combined with
  response compression, initial data loaded by the browser is about
  7-8x less.
- Compress HTTP responses speeding up initial load times.
- New "oneshot" mode - a mode where EveBox directly reads in an
  eve.log file into an SQLite database for one time viewing, then
  cleans up after itself.
- The EveBox server can now process an eve file without an agent
  (basically an embedded agent), storing the events in Elastic Search
  or SQLite
- When using Elastic Search 5.2+, use the update_by_query API to
  archive and escalate events. This should speed up archiving.
- Fix Elastic Search keyword handling when Filebeat is used to send
  eve logs directly to Elastic Search.
- Reports:
  - In addition to the event views, there are now some report views.
- EveBox Agent:
  - The EveBox agent is a replacement for Filebeat and/or Logstash. It
    can read Suricata eve log files sending them to the EveBox server
    which will then store them to the configured data store (Elastic
    Search or SQLite).
- SQLite Support:
  - SQLite can now be used as a backend. This is suitable for smaller
	installations where event load is light.
  - Reports are currently not supported with SQLite.
- If the agent is being used to submit events and the datastore is
  Elastic Search, create a template if one doesn't already index for
  the configured index. For Elastic Search 2.x and Logstash 2 template
  is used, for Elastic Search 5.x and Logstash 5 template is used.
- A start on some documentation:
  http://evebox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## 0.5.0 - 2016-06-17
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0)
- EveBox is now runs as a server instead of just some static files
  that use the browser to connect directly to Elastic Search. This
  will allow:
  - Simple setup and dealing with CORS.
  - A platform to provide new features and other database options
    moving forward.

## 0.4.0 - 2015-12-10
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0)
- Depends on Elastic Search 1.3.0+.
- Use Groovy for Elastic Search scripting.  Works with the default
  configuration now (no need to enable dynamic scripting).
- Use the new top hits aggregation in ES 1.3 to limit the number of
  trips to the ES to build an aggregate view.
- Display packet and payload data now available in Suricata eve logs
  (Only in Suricata git builds as of now).

## 0.2.0 - 2014-05-20
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/jasonish/evebox/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0)
