API
===

EveBox exposes an API to the web based frontend that may be useful for
other purposes. While the API is not stable yet, this is an attempt to
document endpoints that are somewhat stable.

GET /api/1/alerts
-----------------

The `alerts` endpoint returns alert groupings as seen in the EveBox
*Inbox*, *Escalated* and *Alerts* views. An individual alert group is
considered to be a grouping of a signature id, source address and
destination address with a count of the number of times that event
occurred and a time range containing the oldest occurrence of the
alert, and newest occurrence. Additionally, the most recent occurence
of the alert is returned.

In SQL terms the grouping is like ``GROUP BY signature_id, GROUP BY
src_ip, GROUP BY dest_ip``.

Query Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. option:: time_range

   Time range to limit matching alerts to. Only alerts between 'now'
   and time_range ago will be returned.

   Examples:

   - Last minute: ``60s``
   - Last hour: ``3600s``
   - Last 24 hours: ``86400s``

   At this time only the 's' unit is support for seconds.

   This parameter is not allowed with ``min_ts`` or ``max_ts``.

.. option:: min_ts

   Specify the minimum timestamp for the range of the query. Alerts
   occuring on this time or after will be included.

.. option:: max_ts

   Specify the maximum timestamp for the range of the query. Alerts
   occurring before or on this time will be included.

.. option:: tags

   A list of tags that events must, or must not have. Tags are
   commented separated, and if prefixed with "-", only alerts not
   having that tag will be returned.

   The EveBox *inbox* is made of alerts that have not been archived,
   so use the value "-evebox.archived". The *escalated* view is made
   of alerts that have the "evebox.escalated" tagged and would be
   queries with a value of "evebox.escalated".

.. option:: query_string

   Query string alerts must match. The format of the query string
   varies depending on the datastore used.
